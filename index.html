        <h2>What are dogs?</h2>
        <p>The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf &#128058;. Also called the domestic dog &#128054;, it is
            derived from the
            extinct
            Pleistocene wolf, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. <br>Dogs were the first species
            to
            be
            domesticated by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago before the development of agriculture.</br></p>

        <p>Dogs are the <em>most</em> variable mammal on earth with around <strong>450 <span>globally</span></strong>
            &#127757; recognized
            dog
            breeds. In the Victorian
            era, directed human selection developed the modern dog breeds, which resulted in a vast range of
            phenotypes.
            <br> Most breeds were derived from small numbers of founders within the last 200 years, and since then
            dogs
            have undergone rapid phenotypic change and were formed into today's modern breeds due to artificial
            selection imposed by humans.</br>
